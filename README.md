# Final Project
Repository containing all files related to Coderhouses Data Science specialization's final project. Group members are Raquel Jorge de Oliveira and Pedro Carrijo Moreira. Mentor is Victor Costa Brito.

## Database
Data from the tenth round of research undertaken by the European Social Survey (ESS). The interviews took place between 2020 and 2022.  The data is available through the ESS Data Portal.  In this round, 10 of the 32 participating countries were included: Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia.

The survey data from these 10 countries were collected through face-to-face interviews and are available along with interviewer data and contact form.  The ESS also foresees the release of a second data wave in November, with more participating countries.

Another interesting point is that this last dataset is also available with the "revised ESS data wizard".  This means that all available data collected from Round 1 (2002/03) through Round 10 (2020-22) of the survey can now be downloaded into a single file, available in CSV, DTA, and SAV formats.

ESS's website also allows registered users to generate and download a bespoke subset of data by choosing a selection of search rounds, countries, and variables.
In several countries where face-to-face interviews were not possible,  the round 10 questionnaire was placed on the field using self-completemethods.  ESS will publish this set separately.

The round  10 questionnaire included the main ESS questionnaire, used in the field in each round.  You can consult it on https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/docs/round10/questionnaire/ESS-Round-10-Source-Questionnaire_FINAL_Alert-06.pdf.  Several questions are asked, but in general they deal with news consumption habits, mainly related to politics; internet usage habits; and general political opinions, such as immigration.  The questionnaire included - and this is what interests  us most - two rotating modules: the opinions and assessments of Europeans on democracy and digital social contacts at work and family life.

## Problem to be solved
Our mainquestions so far are: (i) how do perceptions about democracy vary in Europe?  (ii) is there a demographic/sociocultural component to this?  (iii) is it possible to establish any relationship between these responses and internet usage habits and the consumption of political news?

We intend to refine the problem in the coming months. So this is not the final version of the skeleton of the work. The idea is to explore the database data to answer the questions. We haven't defined whether we'll work with the full database or just a few rounds of data.

We want to work with interactive visualization, inferential statistics and machine learning. We thought at first of all of applying these methods as follows:

•	Interactive data visualization and exploration
o	After clearing   the data, we want to find out what storyit's telling m. We want to see what people answered all the questions, how these answers differ by country or gender, and how the answers to some questions correlate with the answers to other questions. Which country is happiest? Who feels more confidence in politics? Mulheres and men have different opinions about this?

•	Inferential statistics
o	We want to know if any differences are really significant or if they have appeared by chance.  And even if we are confident that an observed difference isimportant, is its magnitude sufficient to be significant? To answer these questions, we will use statistical hypothesis tests and try to understand what we can deduce from such tests.

•	Machine learning
o	Our expectation is that individuals who answerafew questions in a certain way also answer other questions in a specific way.  We hope that certain types of personalities, attitudes or opinions can be observed among respondents. Can we use these patterns to make a prediction of how people feel about something, based on the answers they've given?

## Hypothesis
We believe that extreme political opinions on both sides of the political spectrum relate to the amount of time individuals spend on social media.  That is, the more people inform themselves on social media, the more radical their opinions will be. We also believe that the national context can influence these opinions.
Again, that's an initial hypothesis. We intend to refine it before we can effectively start analyzing the data.

## Target
We haven't defined it yet.
